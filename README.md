# Anemia-Detection-System-using-Pyke-GUI


The project is about different types of Anemia. It makes the patients choose between some symptoms or causes
of the disease and predicts whether they have anemia, mild anemia (occurs if the patient doesn't have all the 
symptoms) or don't have anemia at all.
The data contains 4 different types of anemia which are: 
	1. Iron Deficiency Anemia which patient has a desire for non-edible material, lack of concentration,
	dry skin, thin hair and poor weight gain and consuming iron rich food less than 4 times per month.
	2. Folic Acid Deficiency Anemia which patient has diarrhea, tongue redness or hotness or pain, tingling
	sensations in hands or legs and consuming goats' milk frequently.
	3. Thalassemia Anemia which patient has enlarged liver or spleen or both, yellowish discoloration of skin,
	leg ulcers, requiring frequent blood transfusion and having family members diagnosed with thalassemia.
	4. Fanconi anemia which patient has a history of frequent repeated infections within a short period of 
	time, any form of bleeding following a minor incident, thumb anomalies since birth, drooping eyelids 
	and hearing loss and/or any ear anomalies.
  
  -For each of the mentioned types of Anemia above you will find in the document inside the folder the main symptoms of each type in a question way.
  
  
  - The used library to create the GUI is PySimpleGUI 
  
  -To run the code you need to delete the compiled_krb file and you will need to repeat this every time you run the code or the changes you make won't happen.
